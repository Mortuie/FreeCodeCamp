# FreeCodeCamp Projects Repository

## Introduction
This is a repository which houses all of my experimental projects which I have completed whilst following the [Freecodecamp open source curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.com). This curriculum is split into three different sections, the frontend curriculum, the data visualisation curriculum and the backend curriculum. The technologies that you are exposed to include: JavaScript, JQuery, HTML & CSS, Aphrodite, React, MongoDB, Node.js, D3.js and many more.
