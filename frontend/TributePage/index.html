		<h2> Short Biography </h2>

		<p> 
		Bradley Wiggins, in full Sir Bradley Marc Wiggins, byname Wiggo (born April 28, 1980, Ghent, Belgium), Belgian-born British cyclist who was the first rider from the United Kingdom to win the Tour de France (2012).
		</p>

		<p>
		Wiggins’s early education in road racing was spent mainly in France with a succession of teams. It was not until his fourth-place finish in the 2009 Tour 
		de France that Wiggins, who was previously regarded as a time-trial specialist, shot to prominence as a potential Tour winner. After switching to Team Sky,
		he took time to settle into his new role as team leader, finishing 24th in the 2010 Tour de France and crashing out of the 2011 race. In the 2012 road-race
		cycling season leading up to the Tour, he won the Paris–Nice, the Tour de Romandie, and the Critérium du Dauphiné, three of the biggest races on the 
		professional calendar. A favourite entering the Tour de France, Wiggins took over the leader’s yellow jersey on stage seven and confirmed his historic 
		win on the penultimate stage of the 23-day race after nearly 3,500 km (about 2,175 miles). His victory was widely regarded as evidence that the world’s 
		toughest bicycle race could be won without the use of drugs, and Wiggins was applauded as a critic of doping in cycling; in a newspaper editorial published 
		during 2012 Tour, Wiggins passionately explained why he refused to use performance-enhancing drugs.
		</p>

		<p>
		Shortly after the Tour, Wiggins competed at the 2012 Olympics in London. There he won a gold medal in the time-trial event, becoming the first 
		Tour de France champion to win Olympic gold on the track; he also became the only person to win the Tour and capture a gold medal in the same year.
		In 2013 he won the Tour of Britain. The following year he won a time-trial gold medal at the road world championships. At the Rio de Janeiro 2016 
		Olympic Games, Wiggins was part of a British squad that won gold in men’s team pursuit, bringing his lifetime Olympic medal total to eight, the 
		most for any Briton. He retired from cycling in December 2016.
		</p>

		<p>
		Wiggins was granted a knighthood in the 2013 New Year Honours list.
